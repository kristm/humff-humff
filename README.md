An IOS game developed for Manila Game Jam 2012.

You are the Casanova of cats. You live for ecstasy and the finer pleasures of life. But what nourishes you also destroys you. Where do you find the balance?

## Game play

Chase after many tails as you can to increase your ecstasy - but be careful, your ecstasy is inversely proportional to your life energy.
